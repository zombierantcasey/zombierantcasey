i like the southern hemisphere the best in the morning because the climate is still tolerable. it boils in the afternoons, which is normally when i make my way over to the western hemisphere. 

on days like today, i brim the perimeter, barefoot, along the golden duvet, wishing and pretending that dolphins, fish and crabs exist. 

itâ€™s so nice to pretend. i pretended a lot too when I was younger; it made me feel comfortable. of course, dolphins, fish and crabs do exist, just not here.
